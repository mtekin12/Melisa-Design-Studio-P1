            <div id="body-text"> On a FenceÂ was done as part of Paths to Pier 42, a pop-up park on the Lower East Side waterfront. The project transforms the fence surrounding the park into an interactive structure that incorporates color and signage on the outside, and seating and play areas on the inside. The project inverts the function and meaning of the fence from a physical barrier to a place of inclusion. Through workshops, meetings, and volunteer opportunities, we engaged with a number of local residents to design and build the work.</div>
